# Novus Bugs Found During Nox Development

Bugs discovered while building the Nox package manager. These are issues with the Novus language/compiler, not with Nox itself.

## Bug 1: Function overloading doesn't resolve across modules

**Severity:** Medium
**Workaround:** Use non-overloaded function names (e.g. `i32_to_str` instead of `int_to_str`)

When a function like `int_to_str` is overloaded (one version for `i32`, one for `i64`), the overloaded names get mangled and the compiler doesn't resolve the calls properly when the function is defined in one module and called from another.

GolemMC's standard_lib.nov already has the workaround: separate `i32_to_str()` and `i64_to_str()` functions that aren't overloaded.

## Bug 2: Global variables in the main module don't work in functions

**Severity:** Medium
**Workaround:** Use functions that return the value instead of global variables

From GolemMC: "version info - in a function cos globals in main module dont work in funcs". Global variables declared in the main module file cannot be read from functions in the same file. The workaround is to wrap the value in a function:

```novus
// BAD - won't work in functions
let version: str = "1.0.0";

// GOOD - works everywhere
fn get_version() -> str {
    return "1.0.0";
}
```

## Bug 3: Functions inside `#if` blocks in imported files are not visible

**Severity:** High
**Workaround:** Don't use `#if` blocks in library files that need to export functions. Use file-level organisation instead (e.g. separate `darwin_arm64.nov` and `windows_amd64.nov` files).

When a function is defined inside a `#if(os == "darwin") { ... }` block within an imported file, the function is not visible to the importing file, even when the condition evaluates to true. The same `#if` block works correctly when used in the main file being compiled.

```novus
// lib/platform.nov - functions inside #if are NOT visible to importers
module platform;
#if(os == "darwin") {
    fn my_func() -> i32 { return 42; }  // invisible to importers!
}

// main.nov - this fails with "undefined function"
import lib/platform;
fn main() -> i32 { return my_func(); }  // ERROR: undefined function
```

## Bug 4: Nested `#if` blocks are not supported

**Severity:** Medium
**Workaround:** Use single-level `#if` only. Combine OS+arch selection at the file/import level.

The parser rejects nested `#if` blocks (e.g. `#if(os == "darwin") { #if(arch == "arm64") { ... } }`). The inner `#if` produces a parse error: "expected import, fn, or let inside #if block, got HASH".

```novus
// This does NOT work:
#if(os == "darwin") {
    #if(arch == "arm64") {      // ERROR: nested #if not allowed
        fn platform_func() -> void { }
    }
}
```
